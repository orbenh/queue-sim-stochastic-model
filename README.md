# Queue Simulation Using Stochastic Models

[üìÑView Full Report (PDF)](https://github.com/orbenh/stochastic-models-queue-simulation/blob/main/final%20project%20stochastic%20models.pdf)

This project analyzes a single-server queue using **stochastic modeling** and validates results with **Monte Carlo simulation** in R.  
We model an **M/G/1 queue** (Poisson arrivals, general service times) and apply the **Pollaczek‚ÄìKhinchine formula** to estimate system metrics such as:

- Expected number of customers in the queue and in the system  
- Average waiting time in the queue and total time in the system  
- Server utilization rate (œÅ)
