# Queue Simulation Using Stochastic Models

[ **View Full Report (PDF)**](./final%20project%20stochastic%20models.pdf)

This project demonstrates a simulation of an M/G/1 queueing system using stochastic models. It combines theoretical analysis via the **Pollaczek窶適hinchine formula** with Monte Carlo simulation in R to analyze performance metrics like average wait time, system time, and queue length.

The simulation is based on real-life customer service scenarios where interarrival times follow an exponential distribution and service times follow a general distribution (gamma in our case).

##  Key Concepts

- **M/G/1 Queueing Model**  
- **Pollaczek窶適hinchine Formula**  
- **Monte Carlo Simulation in R**  
- **Little's Law for validation**  
- **Gamma-distributed service times**

- `Excel` for analytical comparison
- Theoretical derivations for queueing metrics

##  Summary

The project evaluates a single-server system where arrivals are Poisson and service time is gamma-distributed. We simulate the system to empirically validate theoretical results, specifically the expected waiting time using the Pollaczek窶適hinchine formula, and compare it with simulation outputs.
